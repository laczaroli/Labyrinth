# Labyrinth game

This project is created for Software Engineering course.
It was written in Java, and used JavaFX for the UI, the game logic was given so I just implemented it.
A player have two marks, and he can step with them in four directions: top, down, left, right.
If a player step into a field that has zero value, the game ends with Game Over.
If a player can reach the right-bottom corner with the two marks in the same round then
he win the game and the result going to be recorded.
There are a scoreboard with the player name, game duration, total rounds and the date when the game was played.
Only the winners got recorded.
So have fun and lets break records!
